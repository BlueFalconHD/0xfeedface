Hello! This is my website, `0xfeedface`. I am Hayes, a high school student.
I love programming and learning about security and reverse engineering.
If you're wondering where the name `0xfeedface` comes from, it is the
hexadecimal representation of the magic number for Mach-O binaries, which
are the primary executable format for macOS. I hope you enjoy your stay!
